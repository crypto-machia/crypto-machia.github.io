title: About Whit

Hey! I'm Whit, a writer, content marketing specialist and former nationally recognized business journalist exploring emerging tech (especially crypto & blockchain tech) and crafting narratives that will help shape the digital economies of tomorrow and increase economic freedom for all. 

Here are some quick hits about me:

- [Fork on GitHub](https://github.com/daviddarnes/garth)
- Spent 15+ years as a business journalist, which proved to be an amazing foundation for everything I've been able to do since. Those years were spent interviewing founders and CEOs, researching markets, exploring new tech, digging through government reports, analyzing economic data, grokking business models, etc. So it's no surprise that during that time I developed a keen ability to dive into complex topics, ask the right questions to gain an understanding of the fundamentals, and then distill everything I'd learned into clear writing and storytelling. Being adept at explaining complex topics in simple terms has proven incredibly valuable working in crypto.
